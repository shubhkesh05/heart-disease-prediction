# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Model

A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters.  
The app is built using **Python**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Streamlit**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a trained machine learning model to predict whether a person has a high risk of heart disease.  
The model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application** where users can input medical data and get instant predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Streamlit

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction-model.git
cd heart-disease-prediction-model
pip install streamlit numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
python -m streamlit run app.py
http://localhost:8501
🧠 Model Features

The prediction is based on the following inputs:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

ECG Results

Maximum Heart Rate

Exercise Induced Angina

ST Depression

Slope of ST Segment

Number of Major Vessels

Thallium Test Result

✅ Output

✅ No Heart Disease Detected

⚠️ High Chance of Heart Disease

📊 Model Comparison

The project also includes a performance comparison graph of different machine learning models (KNN and others) for accuracy analysis.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add more ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Upload patient reports directly

Deploy app on cloud (Streamlit Cloud / Render)

Improve UI and visualization
